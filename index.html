        My Dear, Anne-Coralie Madison Cheron
        My pookie lookie shoo my love I want fo say
        And i love how amazing, perfect and different you are
        That's why I give you everything I have; all my attention, all my time, all my energy, all my love and care, all my money too😂
        I cherish and love you that's why I keep trying to understand the issue i have and work on them cause  you deserve my best 
        You deserve me full best and
        I will continue to love you unconditionally 
        I don't care how much I've done for you I will keep doing more to show you how my I want you in my life as my forever partner 
        And I sincerely apologize that on the day of the 14th it didn't go as you fantasize even if we ended up spending a goodnight together before we slept it was actually nice
        But what I'm trying to say is I know you like to have fantasies here and there and the 14th is one of those days you like it to happen and it didn't as you imagined 
        I know that and I know and understand why it didn't and I will from now on understand and change the things that cause it to happen 
        And as for after 
        I am going to make up for it by giving you a day sometime the end of this month (i wouldn't tell you when) so good you will forget about not having your fantasy 14th. I am doung this to continue to show that you are loved and cared for and you shouldn't have any doubts and so you wouldn't even think of being jealous about girls 
        You live and you have an amazing life and I want to keep doing things to remind you of that
        I AM THERE AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE I WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL 
        Yours truly,
        Elvis Josiah your Mimi
